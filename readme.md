# Duplii Video Active Animation

This is the animation that will highlight the current speaking user during videocalls and possibly audiocalls. We simply need to assign the class `.active-speaker` to the `div.video_user` element that contains the current active speaker's thumbnail.

I also introduced saner styles for name labels that accustom for different background colors, different name lengths and have a much clearer and leaner syntax. This will need to be carried over to the production styles. Find them in style.scss/.css.

`config.codekit` file included so that everyone using Codekit will be able to get started immediately.
