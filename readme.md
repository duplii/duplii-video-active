# Duplii Video Active Animation

This is the template we'll use for quickly prototyping animations and special effects.

I am also including the `config.codekit` file so that everyone using Codekit will be able to get started immediately.

## Live demo

A live demo of this project can be found at [Insert Link Here](http://duplii.com/ "Duplii | We Make Duplication Happen").

Include an optional image to preview the project.
